# Return2MaxPotentialEnergy

Return2MaxPotentialEnergy (R2MPE) is a redirection reset method that calculates optimal reset direction based on 
Probability Density Distribution (PDF). Generally, R2MPE can be combined with existing Redirected Walking controllers (e.g., 
S2C, S2O, ARC, APF-based, etc.). For more details, please refer to https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2024.3409734
